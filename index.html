			<p>In the spring of 1986 the TRAA was formed by anglers concerned with the state of the fishery in the Thames River
			watershed, particularly the dwindling smallmouth bass population in the North Thames River.<br> 
			The TRAA is not a fishing, club, although most members are anglers and share fishing as a common interest. We are a "hands on" environmental 
			group who likes to work at a grass roots level.<br><br>
			The TRAA is a volunteer organization, governed by a formal constitution 
			and by-laws. An elected Executive, with the guidence of the General Membership, sets the policies and direction for the
			TRAA.<br><br>
			The TRAA has a history of always having a core group of active members supported by those who just want to be 
			part of the solution. Either way, every member of the TRAA is active in their advocacy for the health of the Thames River
			watershed and its inhbitants.<br><br>

							<p>The <span>rainbow</span> trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a trout and species of salmonid native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America. 
								<br>The steelhead (sometimes called "steelhead trout") is an anadromous (sea-run) form of the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus) or Columbia River redband trout (O. m. gairdneri) 
								<br>that usually returns to fresh water to spawn after living two to three years in the ocean. 
								<br>Freshwater forms that have been introduced into the Great Lakes and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead.</p>

							<p>Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between 1 and 5 lb (0.5 and 2.3 kg), while lake-dwelling and anadromou forms may reach 20 lb (9 kg). 
							<br>Coloration varies widely based on subspecies, forms and habitat. 
							<br>Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.</p>
